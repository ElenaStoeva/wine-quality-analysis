# Wine Reviews - Data Analysis

Final data analysis project for ORIE 3120: Practical Tools for Operations Research, Machine Learning and Data Science

For this project, we analyzed a dataset of wine reviews scraped from the Wine Enthusiast Magazine. It includes features such as reviewer, country, and province of origin, price, variety,
vintage, winery, and ratings, on a scale from 0-100, of different wines. The overall goal of our project is to understand what features contribute to high ratings for wines
so that we can provide consumers with recommendations about what to look for when purchasing a bottle of wine. We explored the following questions in this report to answer our
overarching question.

1. How does price affect wine quality and how well can we predict wine rating from the
price?
2. How do other qualitative variables, such as winery, category, country, and variety affect
the rating?
3. How can temperature and precipitation help us predict rating?
4. How does reviewersâ€™ personal taste affect ratings?
